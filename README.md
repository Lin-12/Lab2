#### Title:
  Computational Process Organization Lab2,variant 6

#### List of group members:
  - Name:Huang Yanlin,  student number:192050222 
  - Name:Lin ningning,  student number:192050192

#### Laboratory work number:
   Lab2 variant 6
#### Description:
   variant 6: Regular expression

#### Synopsis:  
* Support special characters: \, ^, ., $, *, +, [ ], [^ ], { }.  
* Support functions: match, sub.
* Visualization as a finite state machine (state diagram or table).    

#### contribution
* contribution summary for each group member (should be checkable by git log and git blame);
   - lexer.py & regex.py:Huang Yanlin
   - nfa.py : Lin ningning
   - sample.py :HuangYanlin & Lin ningning

#### Explanationï¼š  
 - lexer
    Lexical analysis of regular expressions
 - regular
    About some functions for Regular expression
 - nfa
    Definition of an NFA node the construction of an NFA
 - sample
    About some test for Regular expression

#### Work demonstration 
* (how to use developed software, how to test it), should be repeatable by an instructor by given command-line examples:  
  - We write all files on Pycharm.
  - Use terminal to test the code. like 'python sample.py -v'.

#### Conclusion:  
  * We implement simple library for RE and demonstrate how it works.
  * This lab is difficult for us but we also learn more about it.
  * We add some practical examples in tests which make this code to have practical meanings.
